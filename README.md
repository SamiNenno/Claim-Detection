# Claim-Detection

Accompanying scripts, results, and visualisations to a data set for propositional claim detection. The data set will be published elsewhere due to copywrite restrictions. Propositional claim detection is the task of identifying propositional claims, i.e. claims that can be true or false. Propositional claim detection serves as a basis for automated fact-checking. Further details will be available in a forthcoming publication. This repository is subject to change.
